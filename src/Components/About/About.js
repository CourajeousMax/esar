          Rev. MJ Gonzalez's spiritual journey began at the tender age of 6 when she had her first profound encounter with the Divine. It happened
          while she was standing by her beloved creek behind her childhood home, where she witnessed her initial apparition. This early connection
          with the spiritual realm bestowed upon her the gift of the Clairs, including Clairsentience, Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, Claircognizance,
          Clairalience, Clairgustance, and the capability to perform Home, Office, and Vehicle Energy Clearing, Cleansing, and Protection Gridding â€“ a
          skill set that involves addressing entities, spirits, ghosts, energies, implants, and portals. As she matured, these intuitive abilities
          only grew stronger.{" "}
